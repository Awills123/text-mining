# Reflection 

## Project Overview

For my project I decided to use Project Gutenburg and analyze a set of speeched done by Mark Twain. The goal of looking at a variety of speeches specifically was to see the similarities in his diction and what he reffered to most. To do this I first had to plan out my thought process and what I would do if we did not have to code.
